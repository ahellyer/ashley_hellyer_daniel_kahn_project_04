Movie Mapper is a jQuery application that uses The Movie DB API to get and display information about a particular movie, including movie poster, title, description, tagline, film rating, and production countries. Using the Leafet maps API, production countries are cross referenced with a GEOJSON object of country coordinates, and selected countries are added as a highlighted polygon layer on the map. Once a new movie is inputted, the map layers remove and are replaced with the new production countries.
